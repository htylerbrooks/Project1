- # Project 1 rubric
So this rubric is kind of specific to your situation. I think it freaking awesome that you took it upon yourself to do an additional project over the weekend. It really shows alot towards your dedication to this class, keep it up!

I think alot of the people that did the battleship prompt got too hung up on the logic, which wasn't the purpose of the project. I can see through your solution for the flashcards app that you have a good understanding of the concepts we wanted to focus on for the first project.

That being said, I'm going to give you two rubrics, one for each project. I would focus on the rubric for the flashcard app.


## Software Production
### battleship
- 0, lacks basic functionality
  - in order to get a 1 in this category you would have to create a functioning battle ship, you're closer than you think you are. I would recommend instead of trying to randomly place the ship, just hard code some ships and see if you can create a ui around that.
### flashcards
- 1, no major errors, basic functionality complete
  - in order to get a 2 in this category you would need somre more advanced functionality. Maybe incorporate a third model, like an answer or user model

## Code Quality
### battleship
- 1
  - proper indentation for the most part, clear names.
  - in order to achieve a 2 in this category, when you flesh out the functionality of this program, abstract out methods and define them in your class definitions

### flashcards
- 1
  - proper indentation for the most part, clear names.
  - in order to achieve a 2 in this category, you want to abstract method definitons from your main app.rb file and engrain them within your class definitions

## Associations
- 1
  - for both applications you had associations. The battle ship one had more, but since you were unable to figure out the application's ui logic, it prevented you from using it. I encourage you to tackle this problem again when you have more time, I'm confident you could finish it. In the flash card application you had a has_many and belongs_to relationship which meets requirements.
  - in order to acheve a 2 in this category, you could create a User model or Answer model to track progress in the flash cards app. If you were able to figure out the logic for battleship, you would have gotten a two in this category.

## Tests
- 0
  - no tests
  - when you have some more time, I definitely encourage you to incorporate some testing. Employers like their test.. or so i'm told.

## Docs
- 0
  - no docs.
  - Doc's while not the most important part of this rubric. Documentation can help guide your program with user stories and ERD's.
